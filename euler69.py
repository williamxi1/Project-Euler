# Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function],
# is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n.
# For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.
#
# Find the value of n ≤ 1,000,000 for which n/φ(n) is a maximum.

answer = 2*3*5*7*11*13*17
